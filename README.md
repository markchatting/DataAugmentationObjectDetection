# DataAugmentationObjectDetection
Increase the amount of data available for training an object detection model. These scripts take images and XML files that contain labels for the images and performs a combination of augmentations on the images and bounding boxes by N number of times. The resulting files are text files that are ready for YOLO object detection training.

These scripts were borrowed/copied/inspired (whatever you want to call it) by others:
